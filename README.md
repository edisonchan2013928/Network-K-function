# Network-K-function

This is the code for our paper "Fast Network K-function-based Spatial Analysis", which is submitted to VLDB2022. There are two zip files, namely "Network_K_function_Code.zip" and "Network_K_function_plot_Code.zip", in this code.

In "Network_K_function_Code.zip", this code can reproduce the results in Section 4.2 (i.e., Experiments for Computing a Single Network K-function). 

In "Network_K_function_plot_Code.zip", this code can reproduce the results in Section 4.3 (i.e., Experiments for Generating a Network K-function Plot) and Section 4.4 (i.e., Case Study: Understanding the Cluster Properties for Crime Events in Chicago).
